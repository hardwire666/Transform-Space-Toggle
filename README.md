# Transform-Space-Toggle

This is an addon for Blender that enables the user to set a hotkey to quickly toggle between Global and Local Transform spaces.

When creating a rig in Maya you can hide and lock out specific transforms. For example, rotating a hand in local space only, moving it in world space only, and disabling scale compleatly. Maya makes this easy to do, per object. Blender only lets you manually switch the space used. This is slow and clunky. This addon makes that faster by allowing the user to set a hotkey in the Default Blender Keymap.

Intiall jsut liek any other addon:
<p>https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#prefs-extensions-install-legacy-addon</p>

Use:

After installation set the desired hotkey in the Blender default keymap.

Go to Edit > Preferences > Keymap.
in the search feild search for "transform.toggle_space"
Expand the feild and set your hotkey. (I reccomend double midle click)
These instructions are also in the addon preferences.

his addon was developed under Blender version 4.4.3. Compability with earlier versions is untested. I will update this as needed. There are no additional features planned. This is a QOL addon I made for myself, but I know other animators would apreciate so i decided to share.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A PROGRAMER! I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE! I used an LLM to help me mmake this. So if it doens't work for you there is no promise I can fix it. However it is fairly simple and should not break all that easily..... I think. The code that actually does the work is only 51 lines after all. However, again. Not a programer so I could be compleatly wrong.
