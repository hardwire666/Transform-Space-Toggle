# Transform-Space-Toggle

This is an addon for Blender that enables the user to set a hotkey to quickly toggle between Global and Local Transform spaces.

Maya makes isolating spaces easy to do per object. Blender only lets you manually switch the space used for everything all at once. This is slow and clunky. This addon makes that faster by allowing the user to set a hotkey in the Default Blender Keymap.

Install just like any other addon:
<br>https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html#prefs-extensions-install-legacy-addon</br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
Use:

After installation set the desired hotkey in the Blender default keymap.

Go to Edit > Preferences > Keymap.
in the search field search for "transform.toggle_space"
Expand the field and set your hotkey. (I recommend double midle click)
These instructions are also in the addon preferences.

This add-on was developed under Blender version 4.4.3. Compatibility with earlier versions is untested. I will update this as needed. There are no additional features planned. This is a QOL add-on I made for myself, but I know other animators would appreciate it so I decided to share.

DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A PROGRAMER! I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE! I used an LLM to help me make this. So if it doesn't work for you there is no promise I can fix it. However it is fairly simple and should not break all that easily..... I think. The code that actually does the work is only 51 lines after all. However, again. Not a programmer so I could be completely wrong.
